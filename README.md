# Guidelines

## Packages Installed (purpose)

- Used [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) toolkit to setup the project. **Not `create-react-app`**.
- `firebase`
- `axios` - to deal with the requests POST, GET...
1. MUIv5: `yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` - to use the MUI5 components and designs
2. MUI Icons: `yarn add @mui/icons-material` - for usage of MUI SVG icons

## How to run?

- Clone the repository.
- Make sure the `yarn` has installed. If not installed already use: `npm install --global yarn`.
- Then use `yarn` to install all the necessary packages and `yarn dev` to run the local server.

## How to make contributions?

- Follow the above step.

### For development (New Features)

- create a separate branch - may be of your name, then develop.
- Perform tests, if working fine - make a Merge request.

### For Development (Fixing bugs raised as Issues)

- solve the issue - use the issues page to discuss.
- At last, make commit with the issue no. and make merge request.

### For testing

- Run the project, and try to find the bugs or any component not working in the way it should then raise an issue (from the **Issues** tab).
- Please raise the issue, with appropriate explanation or screenshots -- so that, can reproduce the issue and solve it.

### Tools

- **Backend**
  - Postman & Thunderclient (available as VS code extension)
- **Frontend**
  - React developer tools (available as browser extension)

## Feature Updations Ideas :idea: (For next iterative versions)

1. Filling campaign **tsets**
   - Giving info labels .. to`describe why those fields are required - take ref of`kickstarter

## Resources used for implementation

1. [Inspired from MUI templates](https://v4.mui.com/getting-started/templates/)
   - Pages like `Campaign Creation`, `SignIn`, `SignUp` are inspired from the templates - infact, few are taken directly _(Attributions to the authors)_.

# Work Division

## Milestones of the project _- Total Modules_

1. [ ] Landing page, Login, Sign-in, Sign-up
   - UI & back-end connection.
2. [ ] Campaign Creation
3. [ ] Funding Campaign
4. [ ] Withdrawl of funds
   - Withdraw request raise - by fundraiser
   - Withdraw request acceptance decision - by backer
5. [ ] Ending campaign
   - Normal ending - _(i.e., ending after deadline)_
   - Ending in-between - _as next version feature_
6. ### Blockchain smartcontract << -- **Core** of all

- Regarding each milestone

## Tasks Division

- @Shivrajbande - Campaigns and Smart contract
  - Lacking specificity -- _raises ambiguity .oO What should I do? what will other do..?_
    - Would you like to take..?
      - Funding campaigns
      - Funds Withdraw
      - Ending campaigns
- @BalajiGanesh - Campaigns and Smart contract
  1.  Project Setup & initial deploy
      - [x] Project Setup with vitejs and MUI - done
      - [x] Basic home-page with authentication: {`Sign-In`, `Sign-Up`, `Forgot-Password`, `Update Profile`}
      - [x] Skeleton of Campaign creation - _(pending: milestones - this needs discussion)_.
      - [x] Deploy the project - UI in Netlify - checkout at [here](https://crowdhelp.netlify.app/)
  2.  Creating campaigns _-- Need help of others_
      - [x] Taking details from fundraiser -- **without milestones**
      - ~Taking milestones details~ _-- feature shifted next iteration._.
      - [ ] Deploying in blockchain
  3.  Displaying campaigns
      - [x] Displaying _few_ active campaigns in homepage
      - [x] [separate] campaigns page - which lists all the active campaigns
      - [x] Viewing particular campaign - which shows the transactions, option to fund, ~option to raise withdraw request and milestones set~.

      - [ ] Normal ending -- i.e., as the deadline completes.
      - [x] Abrupt ending -- i.e., ending in-between.
- @Manan - Integration of whole application with Solidity and back-end
- @GautamGupta - Designing test cases.
  - Lacking specificity -- Only _Designing_..? Who will take testing then?
